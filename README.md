This is a test repository to practice my abilities using git and github. I have added a test file called newfile with a "Hello world!" line. Also added a pymol image I created in the subject of Structural Bioinformatics and a script in python about a Machine learning model I created to predict house prices in Iowa from a dataset stored in Kaggle
